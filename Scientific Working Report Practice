#### Answers:

##### Hypothesis:
Measuring the glucose level in blood is too risky since you have to put a needle into the skin that can cause infections of the skin,risk
of causing the deployment infectious diseases  such as hepatitis,HIV,etc.One of the main problems in the measurment of blood glucose is
that there is no consesus on the ideal wavelength to detect glucose in human blood in the human body.A wavelength of 1200 nm is proposed.
The purpose is to prove the ability of wave 1200 nm LED to detect glucose in human blood.

##### Experiments:
The model of human blood glucose is made with pure glucose in the aqueous solution mimics human blood,at 50 mg/dl,100 mg/dl,150 mg/
dl,200 mg/dl,250 mg/dl,300 mg/dl,350 mg/dl,400 mg/dl,450 mg/dl,500 mg/dl.1200 nm IR LED and photo-diode provided by Thorlabs,is controlled
using the Arduino,is used to measure the glucose concentration in the model in the cuvette.LED fired using twin table model,in Width
Modulation (PWM) 10 Pulse different intensity, and improved value using Fast Fourier Transform.The correlation between the concentration 
of glucose intended and photo-diode reading is calculated using Libre Office Calc,

 
 ##### Conclusion:
 Based on the recearch that has been done is made a conclusion that the measurement of glucose solution by using wavelength of 1200 nm
 LED that concretation value closer to 1 or -1 is said to be good.

 #### Answers:
 
 ##### Hypothesis:
 Usually, the terminal of modern large hub airport adopts airport terminal layout combined single line with corridors. As the airport 
 station facilities of information system terminal equipments and electromechanical equipments located every reservation generally use 
 SCADA technology and information system to collect working condition, monitor and remote operation these facilities. Such as passenger 
 boarding bridge located in landing field. Loop redundant of industrial ethernet is a reasonable scheme to access these facilities to 
 SCADA system network in a optimal way by the most reasonable technology and the minimum resources cost. 
 
 ##### Experiments:
 In case of using Loop redundant of industrial ethernet model we have less reliance on access equipments gathering switch.To avoid the 
 fault of single gathering switch, otherwise, it will result in its some part of bottom terminal exchanges without connecting the core
 server. Meanwhile, it provides a redundant link for network data transmission and greatly improves the network reliability, which is a 
 perfect choice for industry control information transmission.To facilitate management and unified deployment, we can design the server 
 between networks as a network model, and every access on ring network equipments are designed as a network model. 
 
 
 ##### Conclusion:
 With the sustainable development of economy, it has made significant improvements in whole civil aviation. As the hub airport
 scale expands gradually, industrial hiper-ring Ethernet shall provide more reliable and stable supports to station site  equipments 
 access of hub airport, it will be used more and more widely.

 #### Answers:
 
 ##### Hypothesis:
 High-resolution digital voltmeters (DVMs) can be widely used when precise measurements are needed, but input circuitry can contribute 
 to the results of measurement. Therefore, to make uncertainty of measurement as small as possible for a particular measurement, it is
 necessary to characterize its input parameters. In this paper the methods for the determination of input resistance, input capacitance
 and input offset current of widely used precise DVMs HP 3458A with 8 1/2-digit resolution are presented. The method with voltage source
 and high-ohmic divider resistor has been developed for the determination of both input offset current IS and input resistance RV.
 
 ##### Experiments:
 A. Determination of Input Offset Current Is
 First, the measurement step of the method is the measurement of offset voltage U0 of the TA when the DVMâ€™s input terminals are shorted
 with switch S.The next steps begins by opening switch S and setting the output voltage of the calibrator to 0 V.
 B. Determination of Input Resistance RV
 For the determination of input resistance RV , the calibrator output must be set on voltage UC (for example, 10 V). After the stationary
 state has been achieved, voltage UV has been measured by DVM.
 C. Determination of Input Capacitance CV
 A stepped voltage of 10 V was applied, and a faster sampling rate was used to scan the exponential growth of UV . Using an approprate
 exponential growth of UV . Using an appropriate exponential fitting function, time constant RP CV has been determined,and then,the 
 input capacitance is calculated. 
 
 
 ##### Conclusion:
 The use of precise DVMs for high-accuracy measurements needs to address all possible sources of errors. The DVM input circuitry can
 contribute to the measurement uncertainty, and it is therefore important to characterize it. The methods presented in this paper can
 be used for accurate determination of DVM input parameters. The method with voltage source and high ohmic resistor divider has been
 developed for the determination of both input offset current IS and input resistance RV . The second method with the source of linear
 voltage ramp and picoampermeter is primarily used for the determination of input capacitance CV . It was shown  than the input 
 parameters are fairly stable during a period of 10 min.
